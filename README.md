You can start editing the page by modifying src/app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### ðŸ¤¯ There're a few problems, ideas and considerations

- Since there's a challenge project with a very time constraint, implementing CI CD will not be my priority, we can absolutely go crazy with it by create a github workflows to checking for linting, formating, testing condition for every changes we made before merging to the `master` branch, and check the same before deploy the code to production

- It's my first time building application with CMS ever, therefore I'm still not figure out what's the problem with the Deployment process of PayloadCMS. 
I've tried many ways + upload images to S3 bucket, deploy the project to payload CMS cloud server, but it failed many times and I got out of time.
